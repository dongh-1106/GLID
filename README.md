# GLID
Glacial lake dataset for paper "Efficient glacial lake mapping by leveraging deep transfer learning and a new annotated glacial lake dataset"

The GLID dataset contains a total of 16,000 samples, and the size of each sample is 512*512. Each sample consists of an image and a corresponding label. Four glacial lake types including supraglacial lake, proglacial lake, ice-marginal lake, and unconnected glacial lake are involved. The pixel value of the glacier lake in annotation map is labeled 255 and background is labeled 0.
