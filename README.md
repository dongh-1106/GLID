# GLID
Glacial lake dataset for paper "Efficient glacial lake mapping by leveraging deep transfer learning and a new annotated glacial lake dataset"

The GLID dataset contains a total of 16,000 samples, and the size of each sample is 512*512. Each sample consists of an image and a corresponding label. Four glacial lake types including supraglacial lake, proglacial lake, ice-marginal lake, and unconnected glacial lake are involved. The pixel value of the glacier lake in annotation map is labeled 255 and background is labeled 0. 

The GLID training dataset (16,000 samples) can be download from [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1nKWAsepSUpfpfX_t48vJnQ), and validation dataset (2,367 samples) can be download from [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1lOkHdXpFoC91pjdXJfNl_w?pwd=GLID), extraction code is [GLID]
